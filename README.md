Project proposal:

Badminton Player Finder App

Badminton is a popular sport enjoyed by millions worldwide, and finding suitable opponents for matches can sometimes be challenging. My proposed Badminton Player Finder Application aims to solve this problem by providing a platform for badminton players to connect, find opponents of similar skill levels within their region, and arrange matches conveniently.

Problem:
Difficulty in finding suitable opponents for badminton matches, especially for players of intermediate to advanced skill levels.
Lack of a centralized platform for players to connect and arrange matches based on their preferences.
Inefficient methods of recording match outcomes and tracking player statistics.

Solution:
This Badminton Player Finder Application offers a comprehensive solution to address the above problems:
1.User-friendly interface allowing players to input their name, region, and skill level.
2.Algorithm to match players based on region and skill level, ensuring fair and balanced matches.
3.Capability to record match outcomes (wins/losses) and track player statistics over time.
4.Integration with a text file-based storage system to persist player data securely.

Features:
User Registration: Players can register with their basic information (name, region, skill level).
Matchmaking: The application matches players based on their specified criteria (region, skill level).
Match Recording: Players can record match outcomes (wins/losses) after each match.
Player Statistics: Detailed statistics tracking wins, losses, win percentage, etc., are available for each player.
Data Persistence: Player data is stored securely in a text file, ensuring data integrity and availability allowing users to track their progress and review past matches.
Reporting: The application generates reports on player statistics and match outcomes for analysis and review.
Player Profile Management: Users can create and manage their player profiles, including personal details such as name, region, and skill level.
Match Search Functionality: Users can search for other players within their region and of similar skill levels to request matches.

Target audience:
Badminton enthusiasts of all skill levels, from casual players to competitive athletes.
Badminton clubs and organizations looking to facilitate match arrangements and track player performance.
Coaches and trainers seeking a tool to monitor their players' progress and performance over time.

User Interaction:
Creating a Profile: Users input their personal information, including name, region, and skill level, into designated text fields. Upon clicking the "Submit" button, their profile is saved, and they gain access to the application's features.
Finding Matches: Users enter their desired opponent's region and skill level into the respective text fields. Upon clicking the "Find Match" button, the application searches for matching players. If a match is found, the user is prompted to either send a request to the match or look for another match.
Recording Match Outcome: Users input the outcome of the match (win or loss) into a dialog box. The application updates the player's statistics accordingly and saves the match outcome.
Viewing Match History: Users can view their match history and statistics by accessing their player profile. The application displays a summary of past matches, including wins, losses, and win/loss ratio.

Week 2:

Write code for classes X, Y, Z.
Develop test cases and test code as it is written.
Update project page with progress details.
Submit code written so far.


Week 3:

Finish writing classes.
Determine where exception handling is needed to ensure the program fails gracefully.
Design the GUI (sketch it out on paper) - include the design in the Weekly update!
Update project page with progress details.
Submit code written so far.


Week 4:

Test, test, test, debug, and test some more.
Update project page with progress details.
Submit code written so far.


Week 5:

Write code to create a non-functional GUI (the "view" part of MVC).
